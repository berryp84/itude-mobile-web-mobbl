# Format: <expression>=<envname>
# Where <expression> should match either 
# 1) the IP address as returned by the DNS or the FQN hostname as returned by DNS
# 2) context(/contextname)
#
# You can use a '*' as a wildcard for IP addresses. I.e. 
# wido* matches wido.itude.com
# 192.168.1.* matches 192.168.1.55
#
# Depending on the DNS config on your local machine use the hostname in stead of the IP address
# Do NOT use 127.0.0.1 for localhost
#
# Matching is done from top to bottom; i.e. the first match is used to determine the environment

# ci.itude.com is the continuous integration server at 192.168.2.11
